## Installation

Use `npm` to install the Felloh Payment SDK module:

```sh
npm install @felloh-org/payment-sdk
```

Alternatively you can use `yarn`,

```

## Usage

To instantiate the SDK, you need to pass the container ID that it will be rendered in and your public key.

```javascript
import SDK from '@felloh-org/payment-sdk';

const publicKey = '1F78BD638B945AED49F4ADAF79CDA';
const felloh = new SDK('payment-iframe', publicKey);


```

Weâ€™ve placed a random API key in this example. Replace it with your actual publishable API keys to test this code through your Felloh account.
